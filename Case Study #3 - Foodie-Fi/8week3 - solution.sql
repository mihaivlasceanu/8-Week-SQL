-- B. DATA ANALYSIS QUESTIONS

-- 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

SELECT 
COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM subscriptions

-- 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value

SELECT
DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date)::DATE,
COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id=0
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

-- 3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name

SELECT 
plan_name,
COUNT(*)
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id=p.plan_id
WHERE EXTRACT('year' FROM start_date)>=2021
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1

-- 4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?

-- SOLUTION 1:

SELECT

ROUND(1.0*100*COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)/ (SELECT 
							   				 COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)

FROM subscriptions s

-- C. CHALLENGE PAYMENT QUESTIONS

/*
The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
	-monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
	-upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
	-upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
	-once a customer churns they will no longer make payments
